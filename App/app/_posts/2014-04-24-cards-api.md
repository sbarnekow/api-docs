Cards

Card resources are located by issuing a GET request to the server with the card's number as a parameter.

Please note:
Since Mingle 3.0, the Card API always uses card number to identify a card. Card id is no longer used. If you wish to upgrade to use the latest version of the API (v2) with Mingle 3.0, please ensure you change all requests to use card number, not card id, before upgrading. It is important to make this change because if you do not specify the correct card number you may unintentionally update the wrong card and damage your data.
All the API resources and examples refer to v2 of the API. Support for v1 of the API was deprecated in fall 2012. Please refer to this announcement in our Mingle community for more information about this deprecation.
Please note that all POST and PUT requests must be in XML format by default. This is not illustrated in the examples here. To specify parameters as shown in the examples you will have to set the request header for Content-Type to "application/xml".
Deleted cards via the API is currently not supported. Read more on how to delete cards from the UI.
