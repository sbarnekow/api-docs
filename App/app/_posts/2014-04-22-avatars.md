<h2>Using Avatars</h2>

Avatars are the visual representation for users on Mingle. We should use them to provide a level of personalization,
familiarity and friendliness to interactions.


<h3>Default avatars</h3>

Default avatars should be used when the user has not loaded their own avatar or Mingle cannot access the users set avatar.

The image is chosen based on the first letter of the users name. If the letter is not in the 26 letter English alphabet then a default image is used.

<img src="/img/posts/ui/avatars/alphabet/default.png">
<img src="/img/posts/ui/avatars/alphabet/a.png">
<img src="/img/posts/ui/avatars/alphabet/b.png">
<img src="/img/posts/ui/avatars/alphabet/c.png">
<img src="/img/posts/ui/avatars/alphabet/d.png">

<h3>Gravatar</h3>

If no user specified profile picture is found then Mingle will check Gravatar for an image.

<h3>User specified</h3>

The user is able during account setup or by clicking edit on their profile to upload a profile image.
