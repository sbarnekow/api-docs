<h2>Using Fonts in Mingle</h2>

There are two main fonts in Mingle. They are <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/overview/" target="_blank">Ideal Sans</a> and Helvetica.

Ideal Sans is a hand crafted sans font that we use for any element which needs to be more important than the main content on the page.

Some places where we use Ideal Sans are for the <em>project title</em>, <em>tabs</em>, <em>card titles</em> and <em>headings</em> for wiki pages.

We have handrolled Ideal Sans into a ott font format. We have included 3 weights.

Normal
<span class="ideal-text-normal">
 The quick brown fox, jumps...
</span>
Light
<span class="ideal-text-light">
 The quick brown fox, jumps...
</span>


{% highlight ruby %}
